Months after the release of my original product, Blueberry System, which dozens of users have rated, here I am releasing its better, safer, optimized alternative. I took all the constructive feedback from the classic Blueberry thread and used it to solve everyone’s concern(s).
Blueberry is a moderation framework meant to replace kicking with UI-based punishment screens. As most of us know, UIs aren’t efficient at all when it comes to exploiters. So security would be a big issue in moderating using this method. Therefore, Blueberry Plus will finally be able to teleport the moderated users to a reserved place, where they can do no harm.
